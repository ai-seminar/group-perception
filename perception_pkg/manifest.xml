  <description brief="perception_pkg">
  This package provides the core functionality of the perception_* packages. It will subscribe to a topic, where point clouds are being advertised. The intention of this package is to segment out objects on a table and to calculate the centroid and the volume of them. To get the results of these calculations, you can use a dedicated service which is included in this package.</description>
